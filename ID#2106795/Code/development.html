                <h2>"Twelve Pillars" Summary</h2>
                <p>Reading Chapters 4 to 7 of “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener was an inspirational experience. One key takeaway is the importance of having goals and purpose in life. Reflecting on my past experiences in high school, I realize the significance of setting goals, as not achieving them left me feeling lost. This book encouraged me to start writing down my goals and stay committed to them. 
                </p>
                <p>Time management is another area I need to improve, as procrastination has affected my academic life in college. I’m working on making better use of my time to avoid the weight of regret in the future, as stated in the quote, "The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons."
                </p>
                <p>I'm often a solitary person, but I've come to appreciate the value of having supportive friends who can guide you in the right direction. I’m also mindful of those who may not have my best interests at heart. This realization has motivated me to be more proactive in my interactions and to seek help when needed.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, I recognize that knowledge is power and that education is just the beginning. I’m committed to continuous learning and growth, setting and achieving new goals, and looking back on these accomplishments with pride.
