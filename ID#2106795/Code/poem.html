                        <h2>Cinnamon Girl</h2>
                        <p>
                            Cinnamon. Longing, feeling hopeless,<br>
                            Sorrows deep within her soft-spoken soul.<br>
                            Her drive not enough, her eyes cold,<br>
                            Cold as ice burning in a field.<br>
                            Field, her future dim and grey;<br>
                            What was once hope fades.<br>
                            Spice of life now bitter on her tongue,<br>
                            Dreams once sweet now ashes in the wind.<br>
                            Daisies wilting, signs of giving in,<br>
                            Sunflower seeds, pollen with no breeze.<br>
                            Conditions weary of one's needs,<br>
                            Her imagery and likeness,<br>
                            An aura oozing from within.<br>
                            Spiritually desperate to find meaning,<br>
                            Healing residue left from painting a<br>
                            picture Of a few words, colorful spectrum designed<br>
                            For the unknown, hidden for no one to know.<br>
                            A reflection of one's mind and thoughts,<br>
                            Slight hesitation, twisted thinking,<br>
                            Great expectations hold her in high regards.<br>
                            End goal? Stuck trying to push through the cracks,<br>
                            Trust, lust, feeling pain all alone.<br>
                            Grains of rice spread across the terrain,<br>
                            Guarding what? Guarding who?<br>
                            Guarding... a date with the reaper.<br>
                            Is she dying, or is it her destiny?<br>
                            Nothing fulfilled, the will of prophecy,<br>
                            Laid to rest in a silly red dress.<br>
                            Confused by this resolution,<br>
                            A lot of unspoken truths, stories left out.<br>
                            Birds sing harmoniously.<br>
                            The end anticlimactic.<br>
                            The end, the end, the end.
