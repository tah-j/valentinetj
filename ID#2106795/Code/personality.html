                    "You have to fight to reach your dream. You have to sacrifice and work hard for it." â€“ Lionel Messi

                <p>Lionel Messi is one of my idols. As his quote suggests, I can't sit around expecting my dreams and aspirations to fall into my lap. I have to work hard and make decisions that will steer me toward my goals for the future. Messi's determination serves as a constant motivation for me to stay focused and committed to my own path towards success.</p>

                <h2>Personality Test</h2>
                <img src="../assets/WhatsApp Image 2024-09-19 at 9.13.04 PM.jpg" width="30%" height="20%" alt="">
                <p>The Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test stated that I am an idealist. It describes an idealist as someone passionately concerned with personal growth and development, always striving to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible selves. This resonates with me as I am always on a quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement, constantly in my imagination, thinking of new ways to better myself. However, I am often slow to act on my impulses and thoughts, being more reserved and not a doer, which is something I am trying to change to become a better me.</p>
