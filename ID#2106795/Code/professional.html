While I haven't fully fleshed out my plans, I believe that with faith, determination, and god by my side all things are possible.</p>
            <h3><b>Mission</b></h3>
            <p><strong>my mission</strong> <br>My mission is to learn more here in college, create connections, and stay driven to work hard so that everything pays off in the long run. Currently, I am not on track to meet the vision I had set for myself. I'm in the process of getting back on track so I can fulfill the goals I've set for my future self. It's not an easy road, with many challenges being faced daily, but I hope to meet my commitments.
